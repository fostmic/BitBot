Bitcoin Trading Bot for MtGox exchange

This is a bitcoin trading bot that I wrote for the MtGox Exchange. The bot would buy and sell bitcoin on a sliding scale based on set investment targets relative to the logarithm of the market price.  I stopped actively trading and got my money out when I noticed some warning signs in 2013.  Then of course the MtGox exchange went bankrupt in early 2014.  When I started actively trading again with the US based exchange Coinbase I decided to make some improvements and do a complete rewrite in C#.  See BitBot2
