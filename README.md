Bitcoin Trading Bot for MtGox exchange

This is a bitcoin trading bot that I wrote for the MtGox Exchange. The bot would buy and sell bitcoin on a sliding scale based on set investment targets relative to the logarithm of the market price.  The MtGox exchange went backrupt in early 2014 and I stopped actively trading bitcoin for a while.  When I started again I decided to make some improvements and do a complete rewrite in C#.  See BitBot2
